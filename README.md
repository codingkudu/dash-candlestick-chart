# Dash Candlestick Chart

I am playing around with a personal project involving stock price data. 
I thought I would share a Dash dashboard I have made that will plot the candlestick chart, volume bar chart and datatable of the dataframe.
It also can display the chart in daily, weekly, monthly and yearly frequencies. 

## Disclaimer: 
This is only meant for educational purposes only.  
I cannot verify its accuracy of the sample data.
